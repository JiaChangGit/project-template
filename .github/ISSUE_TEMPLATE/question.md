* What are the preferred conventions for writing something?
* What are the maintainers planning to do in the future?
* Would the maintainers be interested in specific enhancements?
* Questions about whether you've encountered a bug in the project. Instead of this Question template, please use the Bug Report template, because we'll need a command-line test case and the other information requested there.
